My my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo I was defeated you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
My my
I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo I was defeated you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you Do I hear what I think Im hearin
Do I see the signs I think I see
Or is this just fantasy
Is it true that the beast is wakin
Stirrin in his restless sleep tonight in the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I dont sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
Youd think that nothin in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I wont sing
Lets not look the other way takin a chance
Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance
Whats that sound whats that dreadful rumble
Wont somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance but drawin near
Is it only a storm approachin
All that thunder and the blinding light in the winter night
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I dont sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
Youd think that nothin in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I wont sing
Lets not look the other way takin a chance
Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I wont sing
Lets not look the other way takin a chance
Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance You say shes been mad at you
Then you say youll be patient ooh

For you Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now theres nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do and you know Im crazy bout you
Kisses of fire burning burning
Im at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Ive had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this
Oh Im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still its making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you Its a nightmare babe and to me its new
Never before did you see me begging for more
Kisses of fire burning burning
Im at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Ive had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
Oh Im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire This park and these houses old streets I have walked
Everything dear will it be here
One day when I am returning
My friends will get married have children and homes
It sounds so nice wellplanned and wise
Never expecting surprises

Leaving now is that the right thing
I wonder it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave it
Im not a coward
Oh no Ill be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong
My friends and my family this dull little town
Buses Ive missed boys that Ive kissed
Everything old and familiar
I wonder its frightening
Leaving now is that the right thing
I wonder it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave it
Im not a coward
Oh no Ill be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong Take it easy with me please

Oh please dont let me down Down in the street theyre all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain playing smart aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
Youre grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags being slow and thorough
Knowing though youre late that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
Im sorry Cassandra
Im sorry Cassandra They came flying from far away now Im under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
Theyve seen places beyond my land and theyve found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream Im an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High high what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
Theres no limit to what I feel we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real
Is it true Im an eagle
Is it true I can spread my wings
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High high what a feeling to fly What a feeling
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please I am just a girl
One among the others nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl
Not a special type in any way
Just one look and you will surely see
That the true Miss Nobody is me
Its an evil world
That has only made me a girl
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I cant believe its true
When you smiled and whispered I love you
Darling I could see
I was meant to be your girl
Its a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that hell never look your way
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun
Its so much more than any words can say
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I cant believe its true
When you smiled and whispered I love you
Darling I could see
I was meant to be your girl
La la la la la
But today I cant believe its true
When you smiled and whispered I love you
Darling I could see
I was meant to be your girl Frida
He stands
Towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me
I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
Hes such a clever guy
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
Hes dressed
In the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me
On his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
Agnetha Frida
High and mighty his banner flies
A fools pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
To grow in size
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
Hes wrapped up in the warm
And save cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry
Frida
Strange how
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more
Pain as there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
Agnetha
Frida High and mighty his banner flies
A fools pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
To grow in size
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
Hes wrapped up in the warm
And save cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry They came from the hills
And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain
Came to hear him play
Play their minds away
Were all following a strange melody
Were all summoned by a tune
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
Sub luna saltamus
They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away
Were all following a strange melody
Were all summoned by a tune
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
Sub luna saltamus
He gave them a dream
He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away
Were all following a strange melody
Were all summoned by a tune
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
Were following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
And we dance beneath the moon Ive always hated my room its so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark for the windows just face the back yard
So I cant understand how its happened how everythings changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere shining
Maybe even when youre not there shining
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
Youre shining like a star in the night shining
I wont let you out of my sight shining
I dont want to lose you I dont want to lose your lovelight
How I remember the first time we went to movie
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere shining
Maybe even when youre not there shining
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
Youre shining like a star in the night shining
I wont let you out of my sight shining
I dont want to lose you I dont want to lose your lovelight
And I feel so good
And I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight
Youve got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when youre not there
Youve got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
Youre shining like a star in the night shining
I wont let you out of my sight shining
I dont want to lose you I dont want to lose your lovelight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I dont want to lose your lovelight
Shining like a star in the night I Ive been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling
I I dont know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think youll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
You thrill me you delight me
You please me you excite me
Youre something Id been pleading for
I love you I adore you
I lay my life before you
Ill have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
Ive been waiting for you
I Im gonna make you mine
Youre gonna feel so fine
Youll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please believe me Half past twelve
Watchin the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds blowin outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Movie stars
On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win

Tired of TV

And I gaze into the night
But theres nothing there to see no one in sight
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I dont care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I dont care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do Look at her face its a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do
And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
Well go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do I was out with the morning sun
Couldnt sleep so I thought Id take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house cause I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before
And I closed my eyes will you leave me girl
Then I realized its a crazy world
As he disapeared in his car
I was stunned and I didnt know what to do
Everything I had ever dreamed
Everything in my lifes part of you
And I just couldnt move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didnt know what it was all about
And I closed my eyes will you leave me girl
Then I realized its a crazy world
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
And you meet behind my back
With other guys
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
There is something you said that you may not know
Theres a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
Hes been gone for a long long time
But hes back and I think hes gonna stay
Youll be seeing a lot of him hes so nice in every way
Then I closed my eyes never leave me girl
Then I realized its a crazy world
So I closed my eyes never leave me girl
Then I realized its a crazy world
So I closed my eyes never leave me girl
Then I realized its a crazy world Did you see that man in the limousine
With the pretty doll he is fifty and the girls only seventeen
But she doesnt care and she never will
If hes ninetyfive she dont give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill
Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
Where the rest of the street can peer
Cause hes the man in the middle never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer not the kind of boss you doublecross
Cause hes the man in the middle knows the way to diddle
Hes never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil cause he wants to be
Man in the middle the middle the middle
In the middle in the middle in the middle
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though hes got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too all that he can spend
He can buy the most nearly anything
But he cant buy the lot his friend Instrumental You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I dont care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I dont care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do Keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ahhaha its a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Ahhaha keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Sometimes when Im lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him will it bring back all the pain
Ahhaha how can I forget that name
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Crazy bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
Then one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Keep thinking
Keep thinking bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking I had to pay the price Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then Im gonna sing it with my rock n roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it yeah
I know that everybodys gonna shout it
And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wide gorilla
Chorus
We do the King Kong song wont you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldnt go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song gotta sing along
Cant you hear the beating of the monkey tomtom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people yeah
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey
So people get together gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music yeah
Cause what were gonna sing is kinda funky
So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wide gorilla
Chorus
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wide gorilla
Chorus x2 I believe your new girl turned you down
And they say shes pushin you around
How does it feel I guess it hurts your pride
Tell me my friend how many nights youve cried
Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
Suddenly
Hes clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight youre all alone
Oh what a shame you really want that girl
She doesnt care still you just dream of her
Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
Suddenly
Hes clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown You hate you scream you swear
And still you never reach them
You curse you try to scare
But you can never teach them
Its a dead end street
Theyve tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane a nowhere train for Elaine Elaine Elaine
Elaine Elaine Elaine you know theyre gonna get you
You try to break away but they will never let you
Its a dead end street
Theyve tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane the nowhere train for Elaine Elaine Elaine
Youre like a goldfish in a bowl Elaine Elaine Elaine
They have your mind theyll take your soul
You come you stay you go it really doesnt matter
Youve done it all before by now they know the pattern
Its a dead end street
Theyve tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane the nowhere train for Elaine Elaine Elaine
Youre like a goldfish in a bowl Elaine Elaine Elaine
They have your mind theyll take your soul
Bjrn Know that you go you know theyre gonna get you
Know that you go you know theyll never let you
Agnetha Frida Its a dead end street
Theyve tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane the nowhere train for Elaine Elaine Elaine
Youre like a goldfish in a bowl Elaine Elaine Elaine
They have your mind theyll take your soul
Bjrn Know that you go you know theyre gonna get you
Know that you go you know theyll never let you
Know that you go you know theyre gonna get you The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years that was the time
Of the flowerpower
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now youre working in a bank
The family man the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Are you the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day worries far away i am the city you let me be
i am the city
Coming through a cloud youre looking at me from above
And Im a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me here I am my arms are open wide
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot
Im the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that youre breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
Theyre grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard youll hear me laugh
Im the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that youre breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be
I am the city
You let me be
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that youre breathing is me
Coming through a cloud
Youre looking at me from above
And Im a revelation spreading out before your eyes
Im the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
Yes I am the city you let me be
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
You let me be
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
You let me be
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale of cotton
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale a day
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale of cotton
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale a day

On Top Of Old Smokey
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courtings a pleasure
And parting is brief
And a falsehearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
Midnight Special
Well you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
Wee the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
Youre in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its everlovin light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well youd better act right
And youd better not gamble
And youd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And hell take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its everlovin light on me on me on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its everlovin light on me on me on me Youre so free thats what everybodys telling me
Yet I feel Im like an outwardbound pushed around refugee
Somethings wrong got a feeling that I dont belong
As if I had come from outer space out of place like King Kong
Im a marionette just a marionette pull the string
Im a marionette everybodys pet just as long as I sing
Im a marionette see my pirouette round and round
Im a marionette Im a marionette just a silly old clown
Like a doll like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody told me how to talk how to walk how to fall
Cant complain Ive got noone but myself to blame
Somethings happening I cant control lost my hold is it safe
Im a marionette just a marionette pull the string
Im a marionette everybodys pet just as long as I sing
Im a marionette see my pirouette round and round
Im a marionette Im a marionette just a silly old clown
Look this way just a little smile is what they say
You look better on the photograph if you laugh thats okay
Im a marionette just a marionette pull the string
Im a marionette everybodys pet just as long as I sing
Im a marionette see my pirouette round and round
Im a marionette Im a marionette just a silly old clown
Youre so free thats what everybodys telling me
Yet I feel Im like an outwardbound pushed around refugee When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold then I think of us
Of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I feel my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumns chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days Some people long for Berlin and Barcelona
They yearn for Paris Madrid and Rome
And I know some who prefer Arizona
And some prefer home
Theres only me who is dying to see My my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo I was defeated you won the war

Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo

Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you Ive been cheated by you since I dont know when
So I made up my mind it must come to an end

One more look and I forget everything

Ive been angry and sad about things that you do
I cant count all the times that Ive told you were through
And when you go when you slam the door
I think you know that you wont be away too long
You know that Im not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you Can you hear the drums Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And Im not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
Now were old and grey Fernando
And since many years I havent seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
Yes if I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando Just a notion thats all
Just a feeling that youre watchin me
Every move Im making
Am I reading your mind
Cause its almost like youre touching me
There is no mistaking
Just a notion
That youll be walkin up to me
In a while
And you smile and say hello
Then well be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on
Must be right
Just a notion
But somehow I know Im not wrong
If its our destiny theres nothing we can do
But tonight is very special
Its the night for me and you Im waitin for you baby
Im sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought youd leave me
But now I know its true
Oh Lord Im blue
Im cryin over you
Im waitin for you baby
Im sittin all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought youd leave me
But now I know its true
Oh Lord Im blue
Im cryin over you
Cryin over you
Im cryin over you
Cryin over
Little memories of things we used to do
Oh Lord Im blue
Im cryin over you
Oh Lord Im blue
Im cryin over you
Oh Lord Im blue
Im cryin over you I have a dream a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream Love love is a dream
We were like two young strands of driftwood
Caught up in a stream
We were destined for each other
From our very first hello
We came bustin through that river dam
And made that river flow
We will sail upon the ocean
Til the shoreline meets the sky
Carried on the first trade wind
That favours you and I
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
Darling this time were on our way
Cause were here
And here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
Life oh life is a chance
We were the only two who spun the wheel
And never scored romance
If wed stayed to play for fortune
Wed have broke the banks of gold
Wed have taken old Las Vegas
For every cent that she could hold
Love like ours was made in heaven
It was blessed by Lord above
We will spend our lives together
Forever hand in glove
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
Darling this time were on our way
Cause were here
And here well stay
We wont ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here well stay
We wont ever throw this love of ours away
Cause were here
And here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
We are here
Here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
Cause were here
And here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
So we are here
And here well stay
We will never throw this love of ours away El reloj
Ya marco medianoche
Y otra vez encontr
Que tan solo me acompaa la TV
El soplar
De ese viento afuera
Vive la desolacin
Me oprime con angustia el corazn
No hay mas que soledad
Nadie ni por piedad
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar
Tantos hay
Con gran suerte y fortuna
Todo pueden conseguir
Tan distinto a lo que tengo que vivir
Aburrida me encuentro esta noche
Y la gran oscuridad
Es mi siempre obligada amistad
No hay mas que soledad
Nadie ni por piedad
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
No hay mas que soledad
Nadie ni por piedad
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar The poster on the wall of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free
The hero of them all
Youre a legend
I guess Ill never get a chance to know you
Still youre close as can be
Make the bandstand to a dreamland Rubber Ball Man
Clapping your hands let your feet dance Rubber Ball Man
When youre jumping up and down nobodys standing still
Some of us dreaming some of us screaming
Look at your fans how we love you Rubber Ball Man Sitting in the darkest corner
In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me someone save me
I could see the look she gave me oh
Oh yeah and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do
Lets go girl

Come on baby lets dance
To the rocknroll band

Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby lets dance

Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager ad a settler they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens or if I search inside
Well it really doesnt matter as long as I can tell myself
Ive always tried
Like a roller in the ocean life is motion
Move on
Like a wind thats always blowing life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it being in it
With the urge to move on
Ive travelled every country Ive travelled in my mind
It seems were on a journey a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean la la la la la lala
Life is motion la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like a wind thats always blowing la la la la la lala
Life is flowing la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala

Life is dawning la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
How I treasure every minute la la la la
Being part of it la la la la
Being in it la la la la
With the urge to move on
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive to feel the sun that follows every rain
Like a roller in the ocean la la la la la lala
Life is motion la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like a wind thats always blowing la la la la la lala
Life is flowing la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like the sunrise in the morning la la la la la lala
Life is dawning la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
How I treasure every minute la la la la
Being part of it la la la laah

La la la la la lala la la la la la lala la la la lala
Like a wind thats always blowing No smiles not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like youve done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless
One man one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow well help each other through the hard times
One man one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
Whats wrong what is happening where did all our love go
Sometimes when I just cant cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying
One man one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow well help each other through the hard times
One man one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
Daydreams of a better life but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shakeup
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And its never too late for changing
One man one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow well help each other through the hard times
One man one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
You and me to the end Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine
Where did it go
I just dont know
But still my love for you will live forever
Hasta Maana til we meet again
Dont know where dont know when
Darling our love was much too strong to die
Well find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Maana say well meet again
I cant do without you
Time to forget send me a letter
Say you forgive the sooner the better
Hasta Maana baby Hasta Maana until then
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
Where did they go
I just dont know
And I cant tell you just how much I miss you
Hasta Maana til we meet again
Dont know where dont know when
Darling our love was much too strong to die
Well find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Maana say well meet again
I cant do without you
Time to forget send me a letter
Say you forgive the sooner the better
Hasta Maana baby Hasta Maana until then So at last youre free
Its the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Yes you can
So youre free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you sad
When you think about the life you hahahad
But youre right you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen
Whats the matter with you
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen
Dont you know what to do
Yes you do
Yes you do yes you do
Yes you do yes you do No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
Its the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Nows the time for us to say
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes man is a fool
And he thinks hell be okay
Dragging on feet of clay
Never knowing hes astray
Keeps on going anyway
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
Its the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what well find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eightynine
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes our will to try
If we dont we might as well lay down and die

But Im stuck where I am
A ship run aground
Youre a shark thats circling
Round me in the water

When you purr like a cat
Im at the end of my tether
And I would throw you out
If I had a brain
But in the end you knock me
Down with a feather
And you know it all too well
I just cannot get away now
You are heaven to me
You are hell
But gimme all you got is what I pray now
Boy oh boy oh my oh my
Im so happy I could cry
Dont ever stop it whatever you do
Have I got a crush on you
My oh my oh boy oh boy
Lover can I be your toy
Cant be without you
You know that its true
Baby have I got a crush on you No ms champagne la bengala se apag
Solo t sola yo el festejo ya pas
Es el fin de la fiesta why hay ungris amanecer
Dnde est ese ayer que debemos proponer
Felicidad felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en ms
Paz amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Why triunfar
Why cuando veo ese mundo que vendr
Nuevo al fin llegar de cenizas surgir
Gente equivocada que pretende estar muy bien
Se los ve arrastrar pies de barro why caminar
Sin saber por donde andar
Felicidad felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en ms
Paz amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Why as triunfar
Creo entender que los sueos son infiel
Al morir no son ms que confites why papel
Es el tiempo pasado why en los aos que vendrn
Quien podr predecir que depara el porvenir
Que nos falta por vivir
Felicidad felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en ms
Paz amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Why as triunfar I know
Ive not been easy to live with
I guess that I can say
The same bout you
But Ive been around just long enough to learn
That nothing in this lifes for free
So remember when youre down and out baby
You can still count on me
Look at me now
Through the good times and the bad
Ill never stop believing in what we have
I say to myself Keep trying
And thats what Im gonna do
As long as I have you
I cant tell you bout tomorrow
I cant even swear about today
But I know that Im not solving any problems
By running away
So here I stand
Not knowing what to say
I need to love you in my own strange way
And this far down the line
Its time for me to say
Im here to stay
Look at me now
Through the good times and the bad
Ill never stop believing in what we have
I say to myself Keep trying
And thats what Im gonna do
As long as I have you
And heart to heart
We can start all over
Its just a matter of trying
I was trying to hide
I was running for cover running away
While our love was dying
Look at me now
Through the good times and the bad
Ill never stop believing in what we have never baby
I say to myself Keep trying
And thats what Im gonna do
As long as I have you
So take a look at me now
Through the good times and the bad Ill never stop believing
Ill never stop believing in what we have no no
I say to myself Keep trying
And thats what Im gonna do thats what Im gonna do
As long as I have you oh no
Thats what Im gonna do baby
Ill never stop believing I had a dream there was a rainbow
Over the mountains over the sea
Just you and me we were go walking together
Watching the sunrise over the trees
WaOoWaOoWa

True love holding us together

Fantasy Island you know we have a dream I have a dream a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that wellknown sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that Im losing her forever
And without really entering her world
Im glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see whats in her mind
Each time I think Im close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake I let precious time go by
Then when shes gone theres that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I cant deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Well some of that we did but most we didnt
And why I just dont know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see whats in her mind
Each time I think Im close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absentminded smile Frida Now theres a shadow falling over our faces
Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while well start to pick up the traces
We wont find the missing parts
Buy me a ticket Ill go to the Bahamas
I need a rest from our petty little dramas
Yes I really do
Agnetha Frida Aha mm
Now look what youve done
Im missing all the fun
Baby you owe me one
Aha mm
Its my turn to run
A chance to feel the sun
Baby you owe me one
Frida I wasnt ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation in our eyes
Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think its better to view it from a distance
Yes I really do
Agnetha Frida Aha mm
Now look what youve done
Im missing all the fun
Baby you owe me one
Aha mm
Its my turn to run
A chance to feel the sun
Baby you owe me one
Aha mm

Aha He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people different ages
But they had nothing to say
At least not until the day
When something special he read
This is what it said
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
Were the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
Were the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
He called the number and a voice said Alice Whiting
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold hed struck
He said I read your ad it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why dont we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
I cant forget what I read
This is what it said
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
Were the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
Were the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one Im hearing images Im seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me straight to my heart
So strange yet were so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
Let them wake me let them now let them take me
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old Alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where Im one with every grand illusion
No disturbance no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
All illusion no disturbance no intrusion
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes I let the music speak
I let the music speak Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl youd remember but shes still something special
If you knew her I am sure youd agree
Cause I know shes got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be
Nina pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment shes waited for
Just like Cinderella
just like Cinderella
Nina pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day
So shes back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost neverending stream
Doesnt talk very often kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think shes a bore
But they wouldnt know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store
Nina pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment shes waited for
Just like Cinderella
just like Cinderella
Nina pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
She would like to play it every day Sometimes when Im mad
Theres a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
Theres a voice in me that says You shouldnt be so mean
Oh no oh no
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde
Were like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I
I dont think Im different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And youll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak
Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
Oh no oh no
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me
Cause its an explanation to my split identity
Were like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I
I dont think Im different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And youll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak
Me and I
Were like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I
I dont think Im different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And youll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak
Were like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I Where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice it used to be so good
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me
S O S
The love you gave me nothing else can save me
S O S
When youre gone
How can I even try to go on
When youre gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love it used to be so good
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me
S O S
The love you gave me nothing else can save me
S O S
When youre gone
How can I even try to go on
When youre gone
Though I try how can I carry on Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
Youd better go
For there is no
Place for you here
Like and old fashioned hero
You stand before me
You think our life is a movie
My world is real
I live and feel
And I can do without you
Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandana too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend
This is the end
For me and you
Now be a bold vacquero
Dont show your feelings
Ill cry while youre disappearing
Into the night
All dressed in white
Unchained and free without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet senorita
Somebody meek
Wholl never speak
Harshly to you
Youre such a cavaliero
Proud never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time
Youll never take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time Come to my loveland wander along
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine beaches and sand
Heres the two bluebirds wont you come to my land
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you
Oh its a tropical loveland
Oh I want to share it with you
Life can be funny
Happy and sunny
Oh in my tropical loveland
Come to my loveland wander with me
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree
Over the rainbow under the moon

Just take my hand Ill show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring
Oh its a tropical loveland
Oh I want to share it with you
Life can be funny

And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldnt fancy me
Thats too bad
So I must leave Ill have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game my life will never be the same
Money money money

And Ive always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal
Now Im sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I aint gonna take it no more
Oh no no walking out that door
Burning my bridges cuttin my tie
Once again oughta look into the eye
Being myself having my pride
No one baby is gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges moving at last

Wanna have peace now we can be free

Hamlet iii part 1
instrumental
Hamlet iii part 2
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
Then I think of us of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumns chilling winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies you were laughing at the clouds
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
Det rcker dr
Ja
Nu hr jag allts vldigt lite frida
Free as a bumble bee
Im down
And I feel depressed
Sitting here
Just waiting
For next bus traveling
Down town
Its a cry and a shame
Isnt it
A beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well I would not be working
On a day like this
I know what I like to be
As free
As a bumble bee
Take a zip of
Every flower
Free
As a bumble bee
What a way
Each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
Rubber ball man
A poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all
Youre a legend
I guess I never get a chance to know you
Still youre close as can be
Make the band stand
To a dream land rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
And your feet dance rubber ball man
When youre jumping up and down nobodys standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us dreaming
Look at your fans
How we love you rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you rubber ball man
Crying over you
Im waiting for you baby
Im sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought youd leave me
But now I know its true
Oh lord Im blue
Im crying over you
Im waiting for you baby
Im sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought youd leave me
But now I know its true
Oh lord Im blue
Im crying over you
Crying over you
Im crying over you
Crying over
Little memories
Of things we used to do
Oh lord Im blue
Im crying over you
Oh lord Im blue
Im crying over you
Oh lord Im blue
Im crying over you

Just like that
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I lead him on
Knowing that someday soon hed be gone
Just like that
As though hed only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
Just like that

Givin a little bit more
Theres a gentleness to everything you do
And its rubbing off on me I feel it too
Im a victim of my loneliness I guess
When you call me on the phone
And Im feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over baby
You know I will
I could never stay on my own
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before
Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
And Im always givin a little more
When Im with you
Givin it all I got to give
Ive never done that before

So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again
Merrygoround
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merrygoround
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merrygoround
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

But who knows
So until then
I can only try and try again

Right at the time when boys like to think theyre men
She used to follow us at school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
We dont want to hurt you girl
But youd better
Look for a friend of your own Suzyhangaround
Better come back when youre grown Suzyhangaround
Nobody wants you around here and thats for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
Thats all that weve got to say
Suzyhangaround
Suzy went home to Mamas arms
Mama said Look shes never done you no harm
So get off her back and let her be
Why cant you play together in harmony
We really didnt know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said
Look for a friend of your own Suzyhangaround
Better come back when youre grown Suzyhangaround
Nobody wants you around here and thats for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
Thats all that weve got to say

On Top Of Old Smokey
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courtings a pleasure
And parting is brief
And a falsehearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
Midnight Special

Please take me back to that place
Where Ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost everyday
I wanted to
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother
Wildest kids you could see
We could play together climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother
Please take me back to that place
Where Ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didnt like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud to be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother
Wildest kids you could see

A thing to remember when were all alone
So dance its our way to say goodbye
Yes all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance dont you hear them play our song
God knows that weve been trying
But we didnt make it cause nothings the same
We just couldnt help it nobodys to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad
Was it just a dream everything we did everything we had
Baby give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me when youre gone
You know I wont forget you
Our love was a snowbird its flying away
You tell me its over what more can I say

Cant complain Ive got noone but myself to blame
Somethings happening I cant control lost my hold is it safe
Im a marionette just a marionette pull the string
Im a marionette everybodys pet just as long as I sing
Im a marionette see my pirouette round and round
Im a marionette Im a marionette just a silly old clown
Look this way just a little smile is what they say

Im a marionette see my pirouette round and round
Im a marionette Im a marionette just a silly old clown

Ist es nun am Ende doch soweit
Kann es wirklich mglich sein
Unser Himmel war wolkenlos
War das alles eine Tuschung blo
Und du lt mich nun allein
Und nun strzt der Himmel ein
Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Wei da es um alles geht
Und man fragt sich nur
Wie wird das noch enden
Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Hofft es ist noch nicht zu spt
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden
War das etwa die Endstation
Und ich merkte einfach nichts davon
Hab ich mich denn so geirrt
Was zu tun war hab ich getan
Jetzt kommt es auf andre Dinge an
Niemand wei was mit uns wird
Wo der Weg uns fhrt
Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Wei da es um alles geht
Und man fragt sich nur
Wie wird das noch enden
Wer im Wartesaal der Liebe steht
Hofft es ist noch nicht zu spt
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden
Alles wird sich vielleicht zum Guten wenden Agnetha Soy muy sencilla

In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me someone save me
I could see the look she gave me oh
Oh yeah and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do
Lets go girl
Its a beautiful place this world
Come on baby lets dance
To the rocknroll band
Lets go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band

Try to hide behind the flowers now
Baby we could have fun together
Come on cheer up lets get started
No use being brokenhearted now
Oh yeah youre gonna feel much better

And Ive always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal
Now Im sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I aint gonna take it no more
Oh no no  walkin out that door
Burning my bridges cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself
Counting my pride
No unright neighbours gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges
Moving at last
Girl Im leaving and Im burying the past
Gonna have peace now
You can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
This is where the story ends
This is goodbye
Knowing me knowing you aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me knowing you aha
We just have to face it
This time were through
Breaking up is never easy I know
But I have to go
Knowing me knowing you
Its the best I can do
Memories memories good days good days bad days bad days
Theyll be theyll be with me with me always always
In these old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now theres only emptiness
Nothing to say
Knowing me knowing you aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me knowing you aha
We just have to face it
This time were through
Breaking up is never easy I know
But I have to go
Knowing me knowing you
Its the best I can do BAnderssonBUlvaeus
Se dice que el ansioso esconde un alma en paz
viajero o misionero va lejos mucho ms
Si miro hasta el cielo o dentro mo no s
ya nada importa mucho si puedo con sinceridad
saber que lo intent
Como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la maana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento vivo y siento
es mi intento y lo hago al andar
Viaj por tantos lados en la imaginacin
estamos siempre andando sin tiempo ni razn
quin sabe las respuestas quin puede elegir
si existen diferencias sabemos que hay
en cada ser deseos de vivir
Como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la maana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento vivo y siento
es mi intento y lo hago al andar
La brisa que acaricia con suavidad el mar
y todas las gaviotas que vuelan sin cesar
lo veo y lo siento y no lo s explicar
esplndido momento sentir llover
y el sol nacer vivir y disfrutar
Como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la maana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento vivo y siento
es mi intento y lo hago al andar

que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento vivo y siento

How lucky can one fellow be
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do
And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
Well go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing

Right at the time when boys like to think theyre men

We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
We dont want to hurt you girl

My head is hanging low
And it aint too familiar
With the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me
But Im looking through your lies
It doesnt really bother you
If this boy cries
This boy cries
I never thought I could cry for you
But honey I will miss you
Til the day I die
Til the day I die

When I looked into my eyes
Cause something sure is wrong

Every smile and every little touch
Dont you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender
Like a bang a boomaboomerang

Oh bang a boomaboomerang
Love is a tune you humdehumhum
By giving away I think youll learn
Youll get love in return
So bang a boomaboomerang is love

On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courtings a pleasure
And parting is grief
And a falsehearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
Well you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
Youre in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its everlovin light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well youd better act right
And youd better not gamble
And youd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And hell take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its everlovin light on me Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine
Where did it go
I just dont know
But still my love for you will live forever
Hasta Maana til we meet again
Dont know where dont know when
Darling our love was much too strong to die
Well find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Maana say well meet again
I cant do without you
Time to forget send me a letter
Say you forgive the sooner the better
Hasta Maana baby Hasta Maana until then
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
Where did they go
I just dont know
And I cant tell you just how much I miss you
Hasta Maana til we meet again
Dont know where dont know when
Darling our love was much too strong to die
Well find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Maana say well meet again
I cant do without you
Time to forget send me a letter
Say you forgive the sooner the better
Hasta Maana baby Hasta Maana until then Went to buy me a paper at the local newsstand
And then I heard them laugh and say
Look theyre gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey whats it good for anyway
So I said
Fellas like to ask you a thing if I may
What about Livingstone
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me wasnt it worth the while
Traveling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didnt that help the rest
Wasnt it worth it then
What about Livingstone
And all of those fellas at the local newsstand
Didnt know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them
Then theres only a thing I can say
What about Livingstone
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me wasnt it worth the while
Traveling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didnt that help the rest
Wasnt it worth it then Im down and I feel depressed
Sitting here just waiting
For next bus travelling
Downtown
Its a crying shame
Isnt it
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well I would not be working
On a day like this I know what Id like to be
As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from
Every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw This park and these houses old streets I have walked
Everything dear will it be here
One day when I am returning
My friends will get married have children and homes
It sounds so nice wellplanned and wise
Never expecting surprises
I wonder its frightening
Leaving now is that the right thing
I wonder it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave it
Im not a coward
Oh no Ill be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong
My friends and my family this dull little town
Buses Ive missed boys that Ive kissed
Everything old and familiar
I wonder its frightening
Leaving now is that the right thing
I wonder it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave it
Im not a coward
Oh no Ill be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong Changing moving in a circle
I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling laughing from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesnt matter just how hard I try
Youre all the reason for my life
Disillusion disillusions all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
Youre all I had youre all I want
Disillusion disillusions now thats all I have
Wishing hoping chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd
Thinking wondering what youre doing
I cant stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then they never shared our love
Disillusion disillusions all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
Youre all I had youre all I want
Disillusion disillusions now thats all I have Agnetha Were not the stars of a Hollywood movie
So whats the use to pretend
Im not so charming and youre not so groovy
Youve got to face it my friend
Agnetha Frida Dreamworld youve been living in a dreamworld
Trust me you just cant escape from reality
Boy meets girl doesnt mean theyre in a dreamworld
Here I am here you are
Were gonna make it together
And within its a fuss
So we can only get better
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me
How I love you girl
When I hold you baby cant you see
Thats the way we whirl
You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesnt seem right
Im getting fedup with your acquisitions
Im not your angel in white
Agnetha Frida Dreamworld youve been living in a dreamworld
Trust me you just cant escape from reality
Boy meets girl doesnt mean theyre in a dreamworld
Here I am here you are
Were gonna make it together
And within its a fuss

How I love you girl
When I hold you baby cant you see

Trust me you just cant escape from reality
Boy meets girl doesnt mean theyre in a dreamworld
Here I am here you are
Were gonna make it together
And within its a fuss
So we can only get better Day is dawning and I must go
Youre asleep but still Im sure youll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along
Just another town another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord just give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
When you wake I know youll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They wont comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamt were made of sand
For a no good bum like me
To live is to be free
Agnetha Frida Bjarn just another town another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord just give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations Until that day
My life had been a river
Following the same predestinated course
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising forces
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well
How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style
Chorus
Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon hed be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
And once again the rivers flowing slowly
Following the same and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
Its become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one Ive known
Repeat chorus Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale of cotton
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale a day
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale of cotton
Gonna jump down spin around pick a bale a day
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale of cotton
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale a day
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale of cotton
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale a day
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale of cotton
Oh Lordy
Pick a bale a day
Oh Lordy

Oh Lordy

At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo I was defeated you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
My my
I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo I was defeated you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo couldnt escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you Half past twelve
Watchin the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds blowin outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Movie stars
On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
Its so different from the world Im living in
Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But theres nothing there to see no one in sight
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified cause he was taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldnt quite believe his eyes when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care gonna teach him a lesson alright
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me he was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldnt help it I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care gonna teach him a lesson alright When you were lonely you needed a man
Someone to lean on well I understand
Its only natural
But why did it have to be me
Nights can be empty nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
Thats only natural
But why did it have to be me
I was so lonesome I was blue
I couldnt help it it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby believe me
Its better to forget me
Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired you throw them away
Thats only natural
But why did it have to be me
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly theres nothing to do
Its only natural
But why did it have to be me
I was so lonesome I was blue
I couldnt help it it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby believe me
Its better to forget me I can hear how you work practising hard
Playing night and day wooh
And it sounds better now yes you improve
Everytime you play wooh
But its bad
Youre so sad
And youre only smiling
When you play your violin
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle
I think then maybe youd see me baby
Youd be mine
And wed be together all the time
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle your darling fiddle
But I think you dont know that I exist
Im the quiet kind wooh
From the day when I first listened to you
Youve been on my mind wooh
You dont care
Its not fair
And youre only smiling
When you play your violin
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle
I think then maybe youd see me baby
Youd be mine
And wed be together all the time Ive seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn out old phrase
So now well go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again nothing I can do
Like an image passing by my love my life
In the mirror of your eyes my love my life
I can see it all so clearly
Answer me sincerely
Was it a dream a lie
Like reflections of your mind my love my life
Are the words you try to find my love my life
But I know I dont posses you
So go away God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
Ive watched you look away
Tell me is it really so hard to say
Oh this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight were trough
Like an image passing by my love my life
In the mirror of your eyes my love my life
I can see it all so clearly
Answer me sincerely
Was it a dream a lie
Like reflections of your mind my love my life
Are the words you try to find my love my life
But I know I dont posses you
So go away God bless you
You are still my love and my life I work all night I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
Aint it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
Thats too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldnt have to work at all Id fool around and have a ball
Money money money
Must be funny
In the rich mans world
Money money money
Always sunny
In the rich mans world
Aha aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
Its a rich mans world
Its a rich mans world
A man like that is hard to find but I cant get him off my mind
Aint it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldnt fancy me
Thats too bad
So I must leave Ill have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game my life will never be the same
Money money money
Must be funny
In the rich mans world
Money money money
Always sunny
In the rich mans world
Aha aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
Its a rich mans world No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
This is where the story ends
This is goodbye
Knowing me knowing you aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me knowing you aha
We just have to face it
This time were through
Breaking up is never easy I know
But I have to go
Knowing me knowing you
Its the best I can do
Memories memories good days good days bad days bad days
Theyll be theyll be with me with me always always
In these old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now theres only emptiness
Nothing to say
Knowing me knowing you aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me knowing you aha
We just have to face it
This time were through
Breaking up is never easy I know
But I have to go
Knowing me knowing you
Its the best I can do The city is a jungle you better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you dont believe it you better beware
Of me
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger
The city is a nightmare a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner and try not to scream
Its me
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes the spotlight of the city nights
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger
The city is a prison you never escape
Youre forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows and youll see the shape
Of me
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes the spotlight of the city nights
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger
And if I meet you what if I eat you I am the tiger
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger
Tiger
Tiger
Tiger Instrumental Are you sure you want to hear more
What if I aint worth the while
Not the style youd be looking for
If Im sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
Im jealous and Im proud
If you hurt my feelings Ill cry out loud
Im Carrie notthekindofgirlyoudmarry
Thats me
Are you sure you want to hear more
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door
Dont you realize
I may be an angel in disguise
Its lonely to be free
But Im not a mans toy Ill never be
Im Carrie notthekindofgirlyoudmarry
Thats me
I dont believe in fairytales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
Thats me you see

Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl

Dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the musics high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Youre a teaser you turn em on
Leave em burning and then youre gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance Can you hear the drums Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And Im not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
Now were old and grey Fernando
And since many years I havent seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
Theres no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
Yes if I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would my friend Fernando Where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice it used to be so good
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me
S O S
The love you gave me nothing else can save me
S O S
When youre gone
How can I even try to go on
When youre gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love it used to be so good
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me
S O S
The love you gave me nothing else can save me

When youre gone
How can I even try to go on

And honey to say the least youre a doggone beast
So stay on the ground girl you better not get too high
Theres no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey how you thrill me aha honey honey
Honey honey nearly kill me aha honey honey
Id heard about you before Id heard about you before
I wanted to know some more I wanted to know you some more
And now I know what they mean youre a love machine Oh you make me dizzy Vad r det att leva livet

eller tystnad p en 
Att finnas till det r fr mig
att se sommarngar blomma
lyss till vgor frn en sj
Att se ett hav i solnedgngen
Att se ett segel ligga still
Sommarkvll  att frnimma alla dofter
Det r d jag knner jag finns till
Att finnas till  det r att njuta stunder
Att finnas till  det r s stort fr mig
Finnas till  det r ett herrens under
Att finnas till  det r att va med dig
Finnas till det r att sitta
med den vn man hller krast
kanske lppja ett glas vin
Att finnas till d fr varann
medan staden redan sover
kanske tnda stearin
Att ligga dr och knna vrmen
frn den man lskar  sdant vill
jag nog tro mnga tycker r att leva
Det r d man knner man finns till
Att finnas till  det r att njuta stunder
Att finnas till  det r s stort fr mig
Finnas till  det r ett herrens under
Att finnas till  det r att va med dig Vad vrlden frndras vad tiden gr fort
S mycket du drmde som aldrig blev gjort
En sommar blir vinter de varvar varann
Du drunknar i minnen frn r som frsvann
Din barndom frbleknar i minnenas ljus
Du minns episoderen gata ett hus
En sng och en saga r hela vrt liv
En sng och en saga ett kort tidsfrdriv
En sng och en saga som handlar om mig
En sng och en sagamen ven om dig
Vi drmmer om vren och nr den r hr
S visar sig vren blott va en chimar
S kort r vr ungdom en sommar en dans
Snabbt jagar oss ren och bleker dess glans
En sng och en saga r hela vrt liv
En sng och en saga ett kort tidsfrdriv
En sng och en saga som handlar om mig
En sng och en saga som handlar om mig
En sng och en sagamen ven om dig
 En sng och en saga r hela vrt liv 
 En sng och en saga ett kort tidsfrdriv 
En sng och en saga som handlar om mig
En sng och en sagamen ven om dig I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people love it others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
Shes a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
Shes a girl with a taste for the world
The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Shes extreme if you know what I mean
Her man is one I admire
Hes so courageous but hes constantly tired
Each time that he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says thats all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When were alone
Now we better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
Shes a girl with a taste for the world
The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Shes extreme if you know what I mean
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
Shes a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
Shes a girl with a taste for the world
The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Shes extreme if you know what I mean
Shes just one of those who always has to do whatever she please
And she goes
Head over heels They came flying from far away now Im under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
Theyve seen places beyond my land and theyve found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream Im an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High high what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
Theres no limit to what I feel we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real
Is it true Im an eagle
Is it true I can spread my wings
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze
High high what a feeling to fly What a feeling
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please I was at a party
And this feller said to me
Something bad is happening
Im sure you do agree
People care for nothing
No respect for human rights
Evil times are coming
We are in for darker nights
I said who are you
To talk about impending doom
He got kinda wary
As he looked around the room
He said Im a minister
A big shot in the state
I said I just cant
Believe it boy
I think its great
Brother can you tell me
What is right and what is wrong
He said keep on rocking baby
Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
Til the night is gone
Over in the corner
I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty
He was giving me the eye
So I took advantage
Of the fact that Im a star
Shook my hair and took
A casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell
This guy was coming up to me
He said who am I and
Who are you and who are we
Whats our situation do
We have some time for us
I said I was not exactly
Waiting for the bus
He said if youre going
Somewhere can I come along
I said keep on rocking baby
Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
Til the night is gone I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move Im standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books the paintings and the furniture
Help me
The signals sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they dont dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel Im
Crackin up
Voices growing louder irritation building
And Im close to fainting
Crackin up
They must know by now Im in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin up
My whole world is falling going crazy
There is no escaping now Im
Crackin up
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now theyve come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isnt unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel Im
Crackin up
Voices growing louder irritation building
And Im close to fainting
Crackin up
They must know by now Im in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin up
My whole world is falling going crazy

And my life was so empty there was nothing to live for
But then it happened one night
As I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying
As though he was praying
Treat him well he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend one one another
Love him thats the only way
On the road
That were going
We all need
Words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well he is your brother
Love him thats the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely didnt care for anybody
But then I happened to meet
A begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
I heard someone saying
Treat him well he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend one one another
Love him thats the only way
On the road
That were going
We all need
Words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well he is your brother
Love him thats the only way
Treat him well he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend one one another
Love him thats the only way
Treat him well he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend one one another
Love him thats the only way If you change your mind Im the first in line

To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
I have a dream a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
Ill cross the stream I have a dream I dont want to talk
About the things weve gone through
Though its hurting me
Now its history
Ive played all my cards
And thats what youve done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
Thats her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking Id be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
Its simple and its plain
Why should I complain
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
I dont want to talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
Youve come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No selfconfidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
So the winner takes it all
And the the loser has to fall
Throw a dice cold as ice
Way down here someone dear
Takes it all has to fall
It seems plain to me Dont know how to take it dont know where to go
My resistances running low
And everyday the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
You know that Im nobodys fool
Im nobodys fool and yet its clear to me
I dont have a strategy
Its just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Under attack Im being taken
About to crack defenses breaking
Wont somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack Im taking cover
He saw my track my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to Im not sure I wont know how
Now this is getting crazy I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Cause waiting at the answer to his questions is a definite blow
Im kind of certain thats the truth
Guess Im kind of flattered but Im scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where Id be if I fell
Under attack Im being taken
About to crack defenses breaking
Wont somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack Im taking cover
He saw my track my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to Im not sure I wont know how
Under attack Im being taken
About to crack defenses breaking
Wont somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack Im taking cover
He saw my track my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to Im not sure I wont know how
Under attack Im being taken
About to crack defenses breaking
Wont somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue
Like I always do
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear youre comingGlad to hear youre coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And suddenly its gonna be
And its gonna be so different
When Im on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun suppper trouppper
Smiling having fun suppper trouppper
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue suppper trouppper
Like I always do suppper trouppper
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still Im thinking about you only still Im thinking about you only
There are moments when I think Im going crazy Think Im going crazy
But its gonna be alright
Youll soon be changing everything
Everything will be so different
When Im on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun suppper trouppper
Smiling having fun suppper trouppper
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue suppper trouppper
Like I always do suppper trouppper
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you
So Ill be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me Im still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight

But I wont feel blue suppper trouppper
Like I always do suppper trouppper Youre so hot teasing me
So youre blue
but I cant take a chance on a chick like you
Thats something I couldnt do
Theres that look in your eyes
I can read in your face
that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah but girl youre only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think its funny
Does your mother know that youre out
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that youre out
Take it easy take it easy
Better slow down girl
Thats no way to go
Does your mother know
Take it easy take it easy
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young
to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe Im not the one
Now youre so cute I like your style
And I know what you mean
when you give me a flash of that smile smile
But girl youre only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think its funny

And I can chat with you baby Im nothing special in fact Im a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke youve probably heard it before
But I have a talent a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
Im so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And Ive often wondered how did it all start
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can
Well whoever it was Im a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Ive been so lucky I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy what a life what a chance
Thank you for the music the songs Im singing
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say
Thank you for the music for giving it to me Love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do I do I do I do I do
I cant conceal it
Dont you see
Cant you feel it
Dont you too
I do I do I do I do I do
Oh Ive been dreaming through my lonely past
Now Ive just made it
I found you at last
So come on
Now lets try it
I love you
Cant deny it
Cause its true
I do I do I do I do I do
Oh no hard feelings between you and me
If we cant make it
But just wait and see
So come on now lets try it
I love you cant deny it
Cause its true I do I do I do I do I do
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
I love you I do I do I do I do I do
I cant conceal it dont you see
Cant you feel it
Dont you too I do I do I do I do I do Must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train Im certain left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place the usual bunch
And still on top of this Im pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left theres no exception to the rule
A matter of routine Ive done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes Im sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came
Must have opened my front door at eight oclock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
Im sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
Theres not I think a single episode of Dallas that I didnt see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
Its funny but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came I wasnt jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And Im possessive it isnt nice
Youve heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isnt true
Now everything is new
And all Ive learned has overturned
I beg of you
Dont go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still dont know what youve done with me
A grownup woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I dont have you near
Unsatisfied I skip my pride
I beg you dear
Dont go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Dont go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Ive had a few little love affairs
They didnt last very long and theyve been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all Ive learned has overturned
What can I do
Dont go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Dont go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Dont go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Dont go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Dont go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me Keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ahhaha its a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Ahhaha keep thinking bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Sometimes when Im lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him will it bring back all the pain
Ahhaha how can I forget that name
Look into his angeleyes
One look and youre hypnotized
Hell take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
And one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Crazy bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
Youll think youre in paradise
Then one day youll find out he wears a disguise
Dont look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Keep thinking
Keep thinking bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking I had to pay the price You think youre gonna make me sulk you and your fancy car ahhaha
But I can tell you honey your tricks aint gonna get you far ahhaha
They say that moneys got a magic touch
But not to me it doesnt mean that much
You wont have me tonight
All right all right all right all right
So long see you honey
You cant buy me with your money
Chasing dazing driving me crazy
But Ill never be your girl
So long see you honey
You cant buy me with your money
You know its not worth trying
So long so long so long
You didnt have to send me flowers like you did today ahhaha
I wouldnt keep a thing from you I gave them all away ahhaha
The girls might fall for everything youve got
But Im not one of them you know Im not
You wont have me tonight
All right all right all right all right
So long see you honey
You cant buy me with your money
Chasing dazing driving me crazy
But Ill never be your girl
So long see you honey
You cant buy me with your money
You know its not worth trying
So long so long so long Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park
Summer night city
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I cant take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and going strong
I know whats waiting there for me
Tonight Im loose and fancy free
Ahah
When the night comes with the action
I just know its time to go
Cant resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park
Summer night city
Its elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We dont miss them when theyre gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere
Ahah
When the night comes with the action
I just know its time to go
Cant resist the strange attraction
From this giant dynamo
And tomorrow when its dawning
And the first birds starts to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothings worth remembering
Its a dream its out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moon light love making in the park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark

Walking in the moon light love making in the park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moon light love making in the park
Summer night city Ive seen you twice in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
Im getting more openhearted
I was an impossible case
Noone ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
Theres a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know
Whats the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you
Whats the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do
Tell me please cause I have to know
Im a bashful child beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What Im trying to conceal
If I trust in you would you let me down
Would you laugh at me if I said I care for you
Could you feel the same way too
I wanna know
The name of the game
I have no friends noone to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here talking to you
No wonder I get excited
Your smile and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
Whats the name of the game Your smile and the sound of your voice
Does it mean anything to you Got a feeling you give me no choice
But it means a lot

Would you laugh at me if I said I care for you

And all of your sweet sweet talk
Aint heard a lot since then love
Now look at that guy
Hes making me cry
He leaves every mornig
And he hardly says goodbye
But if I would have to choose
I wouldnt let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see your love will grow
Darling I know
We gotta have patience love isnt just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough
Sweet sweet our love is bittersweet
Giving love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough
Sweet sweet our love is bittersweet
From the first moment I saw you
Ive treated you like a queen
Ive given you lots of presents

But hes talking through his hat

I wouldnt let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see your love will grow

Sweet sweet our love is bittersweet
Giving love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark

You were I felt robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now its different I want you to know
One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child stubborn and misconceiving
Thats how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now Ive changed and I want you to know
One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all Half past twelve
Watchin the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds blowin outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Movie stars
On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
Its so different from the world Im living in
Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But theres nothing there to see no one in sight
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Theres not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Wont somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day Heres to us one more toast and then well pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summers over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor Im to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
Were still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor Im to blame when all is said and done
Its so strange when youre down and lying on the floor
How you rise shake your head get up and ask for more
Clearheaded and openeyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroadsno desire to run
Theres no hurry any more when all is said and done
Standing calmly at the crossroadsno desire to run
Theres no hurry any more when all is said and done Agnetha Soy muy sencilla
why algo aburrida tal vez
Las bromas que s me salen seguro al revs
Pero hay un talento en m singular

Por este don en m They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager ad a settler they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens or if I search inside
Well it really doesnt matter as long as I can tell myself
Ive always tried
Like a roller in the ocean life is motion
Move on
Like a wind thats always blowing life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it being in it
With the urge to move on
Ive travelled every country Ive travelled in my mind
It seems were on a journey a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean la la la la la lala
Life is motion la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like a wind thats always blowing la la la la la lala

How I treasure every minute la la la la
Being part of it la la la la
Being in it la la la la
With the urge to move on
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive to feel the sun that follows every rain
Like a roller in the ocean la la la la la lala
Life is motion la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like a wind thats always blowing la la la la la lala
Life is flowing la la la la la lala
Move on la la la lala
Like the sunrise in the morning la la la la la lala
Life is dawning la la la la la lala

Ya marco medianoche
Y otra vez encontr
Que tan solo me acompaa la TV
El soplar
De ese viento afuera
Vive la desolacin
Me oprime con angustia el corazn
No hay mas que soledad
Nadie ni por piedad
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar
Tantos hay
Con gran suerte y fortuna
Todo pueden conseguir
Tan distinto a lo que tengo que vivir
Aburrida me encuentro esta noche
Y la gran oscuridad
Es mi siempre obligada amistad
No hay mas que soledad
Nadie ni por piedad
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Alguien que me ayude
A las sombras borrar
Dame dame dame
Amor esta noche
Hasta que amanezca
Ver el da aclarar
Dame dame dame

Ver el da aclarar I been cheated by you since you know when
So I made up my mind it must come to an end
Look at me now will I ever learn
I dont know how but I suddenly lose control
Theres a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Mamma mia here I go again
My my how can I resist you
Mamma mia does it show again
My my just how much Ive missed you
Yes Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia now I really know
My my I could never let you go
Ive been angry and sad about things that you do
I cant count all the times that Ive told you were through
And when you go when you slam the door
I think you know that you wont be away too long
You know that Im not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Mamma mia here I go again
My my how can I resist you
Mamma mia does it show again
My my just how much Ive missed you
Yes Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia even if I say
Bye bye leave me now or never
Mamma mia its a game we play
Bye bye doesnt mean forever
Mamma mia here I go again
My my how can I resist you
Mamma mia does it show again
My my just how much Ive missed you
Yes Ive been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia now I really know
My my I could never let you go You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the musics high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Youre a teaser you turn em on
Leave em burning and then youre gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
Youre in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance Chiquitita tell me whats wrong
Youre enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that youre oh so sad so quiet
Chiquitita tell me the truth
Im a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend Im the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see youve broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars theyre leaving
Youll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita
So the walls came tumbling down
And your loves a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that youre oh so sad so quiet Sitting in the darkest corner
In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me someone save me
I could see the look she gave me oh
Oh yeah and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do
Lets go girl
Its a beautiful place this world
Come on baby lets dance
To the rocknroll band
Lets go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band
Youve been sitting there for hours
Try to hide behind the flowers now
Baby we could have fun together
Come on cheer up lets get started
No use being brokenhearted now
Oh yeah youre gonna feel much better
Yes I know that you will
Lets go girl
Its a beautiful place this world
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band
Lets go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band
Come on baby lets dance
To the rockn roll band Ella se va tan feliz a la escual ahora
Diciendo adis con ausente sonreir
All se va why en mi siento una tristeza
Algo que me hare percibir
An me pertenece pero menos
En ese mundo de su candidez
Feliz de compartir an sa risa
why toda su niez
Se me est escapando al crecer
Cmo lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos
Se me est escapando al crecer
Su gran fantasa cuidar
why cuando la voy descubriendo
Sigue creciendo
Se me est escapando ya lo s
Hay en las dos ella why yo sueo al desayuno
why sin querer dejo el tiempo transcurrir
Cuando se va siento en m la melancola
Cierta culpa que no s fingir
Por dnde estn aquellas aventuras
Y los lugares que bamos a ver
Algunas pocas cosas disfrutamos
Hay tanto por hacer
Se me est escapando al crecer
Cmo lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos
Se me est escapando al crecer
Su gran fantasa cuidar
why cuando la voy descubriendo
Sigue creciendo
Se me est escapando ya lo s
Si yo pudiera congelar la imagen
Guardar el tiempo why su capricho en m
Se me est escapando
Se me est escapando ya lo se
Ella se va tan feliz a la escual ahora
Diciendo adis con ausente sonreir Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows what hes gonna get
when hes going too far
Living on the dark side once again
Its sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still were going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late Im sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
Its true
Every good man needs a helping hand
so I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
and he knows
what hes gonna get
when hes going too far
Living on the dark side once again
Its sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
Still were going on
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Some of us learn too late Im sorry
Every good man needs a helping hand
Its true I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
Its a dark and dreary night Seems like nothings going right
Wont you tell me honey how can I go on here without you
Yes Im down and feeling blue
And I dont know what to do ohoh
Ring ring why dont you give me a call
Ring ring the happiest sound of them all
Ring ring I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Wont you please understand the need in me
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
You were here and now youre gone
Hey did I do something wrong
I just cant believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you
Tell me are we really through
Wont you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet ohoh
Ring ring why dont you give me a call
Ring ring the happiest sound of them all
Ring ring I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Wont you please understand the need in me
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
Ohoh ring ring why dont you give me a call
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
fade Ill never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy I was tough packing all my stuff
Saying I dont need you anymore Ive had enough
And now look at me standing here again cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta have you near
As good as new my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes I think its taking on a new dimension
Its as good as new my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new thank God its true
Darling we were always meant to stay together
Feel like a creep never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know Im not entitled to another break
But please baby I beg you to forgive cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again
As good as new my love for you

Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new thank God its true
Darling we were always meant to stay together
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
Darling we were always meant to stay together I got appointments work I have to do
Keepin me so busy all the day through
Theyre the things that keep me from thinkin of you
Oh baby I miss you so I know Im never gonna make it
Oh Im so restless I dont care what I say
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still its even worse when the nights on its way
Its bad oh so bad
Somehow Id be doin alright if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it
Id have courage left to fight if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sittin here alone and starin at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it
Somehow Id be doin alright if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
Noone to turn to you know how it is
I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly the things that I miss
Oh baby I feel so bad I know Im never gonna make it
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to bills I must pay
But everythings so different when nights on its way
Its bad oh so bad
Somehow Id be doing alright if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it
Id have courage left to fight if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sittin here alone and starin at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it
If it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
If it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it
If it wasnt for the nights
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights If you change your mind Im the first in line

And my mind is slowly wakin
And my heart has ceased its achin
Im still alive

I cried a sea of tears
And only heaven knows
How could I stand the fears

All shattered and cryin
And thinkin I was dyin
But

My life is rollin on
Gently from day to day
Memories will fade away  yes
Im still alive
The agony has gone
And my mind is slowly wakin
And my heart has ceased its achin
Im still alive You feel bad let me tell you we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden weighed down in your shoes
When its bad worse worst
And when youre feeling so bad
And you think youre cursed
And youve got it sad
Well if theres one thing for the better that can turn you loose
Its gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
My friend Sam is a chauffeur Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends
Together again
When I meet my friends
Im gonna see them now
And were lookin round for the action we sure play it cool
Its gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
You paint your world and use all colors
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know its only a lie
The songs you sing are too romantic
And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah theyre only telling you lies
Oh yeah theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
You feel bad let me tell you we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden weighed down in your shoes
When its bad worse worst
You know youre feeling so bad
And you think youre cursed
And youve got it sad
Well if theres one thing for the better that can turn you loose
Its gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Theres gotta be rockn roll
To fill the hole in your soul
